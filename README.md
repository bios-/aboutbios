Howdy, my name is Bios, or Josh, or Inspector, or whatever you decide to call me.  I am a young programmer, DJ, graphic artist, redditor, and monkey's uncle.  I've been programming for almost 5 years, making music for almost 2, and making websites for almost 7.

In my free time, I work on my operating system, Mirus, make music, play Minecraft on my server, and walk around in circles whilst listening to hard electro.  What a nice life!  I code in *a lot* of programming, markup, and scripting languages, and dabble between all of them from time to time.  But my personal favorites are Lua and C#.  C is the master language!

I like to consider myself a "nu-age" hacker.  The reasoning behind this as follows.  I can't be a real "hacker" by definition, because by definition, someone like rms (Richard Stallman) is a real hacker.  I am also too young to be a real hacker.  As such, let's call me a nu-age hacker (after nu-disco).  Or new-age.  But the first one is more interesting.  All hail new age hackers!

Beside living in code, I also like to instruct others in the dark arts (and programming).  For that extent, I have set up a YouTube channel for teaching various computerstuffs, like programming, music production, graphic art, etc.  You can find it here: [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/iambios)
